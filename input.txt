Smash Mouth - All Star
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb, with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an 'L' on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense, not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up, now wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm, so you might as well swim
My world's on fire how about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon

Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked, could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said, Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up
Oooh

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling

Gotta make you understand

Europe - The Final Countdown
We're leaving together,
But still it's farewell.
And maybe we'll come back
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown.
The final countdown

Oh!

We're heading for Venus (Venus)
And still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us (seen us)
And welcome us all, yeah.
With so many light years to go
And things to be found (to be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.

It's the final countdown...
The final count down [2x]

The final count down
Oh!

It's the final count down
The final count down [2x]

It's the final count down
We're leaving together
The final count down
We'll all miss her so.
It's the final count down.

Oh!

Scarface - Push It To The Limit
Push it to the limit
Walk along the razor's edge
But don't look down, just keep your head
Or you'll be finished

Open up the limit
Past the point of no return
You've reached the top but still you gotta learn
How to keep it

Hit the wheel and double the stakes
Throttle wide open like a bat out of hell
And you crash the gates
(crash the gates)

Going for the back of beyond
Nothing gonna stop you
There's nothing that strong.
So close now you're nearly at the brink
So, push it

(Ooo yeah)

Welcome to the limit
(The limit)
Take it maybe one step more
The power game's still playing so
You better win it

Push it to the limit
(The limit)
With no one left to stand in your way
You might get careless, but you'll never be safe
While you're still in it

Welcome to the limit
(The limit)
Standing on the razor's edge
Don't look down just keep your head
Or you'll be finished

Welcome to the limit
(The limit)
(The limit)
(The limit)

Push it to the limit

Mike Oldfield - Nuclear
Standing on the edge of the crater
Like the prophets once said 
and the ashes are all cold now
No more bullets and the embers are dead
Whispers in the air tell the tales
Of the brothers gone
Desolation, devastation
What a mess we made, when it all went wrong

Watching from the edge of the circus
For the games to begin
Gladiators draw their swords 
form their ranks for Armageddon

I'm nuclear
I'm wild
I'm breaking up inside
A heart of broken glass
Defiled
Deep inside
The abandoned child

Standing on the edge of the underworld
Looking at the abyss 
and I'm hoping for some miracle
To breakout, to escape from all this
Whispers in the air tell the tales
of a life that's gone
Desolation, devastation
What a mess we made, when it all went wrong

I'm nuclear
I'm wild
I'm breaking up inside
A heart of broken glass
Defiled
Deep inside
The abandoned child

I'm nuclear
I'm wild
I'm breaking up inside
A heart of broken glass
Defiled
Deep inside
The abandoned child

Bon Jovi - It's My Life

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted 
No silent prayer for the faith-departed 
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd 
You're gonna hear my voice 
When I shout it out loud 

It's my life 
It's now or never 
I ain't gonna live forever 
I just want to live while I'm alive 
(It's my life) 
My heart is like an open highway 
Like Frankie said 
I did it my way 
I just wanna live while I'm alive 
It's my life 

This is for the ones who stood their ground 
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down 
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake 
Luck ain't even lucky 
Got to make your own breaks 

It's my life 
And it's now or never 
I ain't gonna live forever 
I just want to live while I'm alive 
(It's my life) 
My heart is like an open highway 
Like Frankie said 
I did it my way 
I just want to live while I'm alive 
'Cause it's my life 

Better stand tall when they're calling you out 
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down 

It's my life 
And it's now or never 
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever 
I just want to live while I'm alive 
(It's my life) 
My heart is like an open highway 
Like Frankie said 
I did it my way 
I just want to live while I'm alive 

It's my life 
And it's now or never 
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever 
I just want to live while I'm alive 
(It's my life) 
My heart is like an open highway 
Like Frankie said 
I did it my way 
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life!

Earth Wind & Fire - Boogie Wonderland
Dance, boo-gie won-der-land.
Dance, boo-gie won-der-land.

Mid-night creeps so slow-ly in-to hearts of men
Who need more than they get.

Day-light deals a bad man to a wom-an
Who had laid too man-y bets.

The mir-ror stares you in the face and says,
"Ba-by, uh, uh, it don't work."

You say your prayers though you don't care.
You dance and you shake the hurt.

Dance, boo-gie won-der-land.
Dance, boo-gie won-der-land.

Sounds fly through the night,
I change my vi-nyl dreams
To boo-gie won-der-land.

I find ro-mance
When I start to dance
In boo-gie won-der-land.

I find ro-mance
When I start to dance
In boo-gie won-der-land.

All the love in the world can't be gone.
All the need to be loved can't be wrong.

All the rec-ords are play-ing,
And my heart keep say-in',
Boo-gie won-der-land, won-der-land.

Dance, boo-gie won-der-land.
Dance, boo-gie won-der-land.

I find ro-mance
When I start to dance
In boo-gie won-der-land.

I find ro-mance
When I start to dance
In boo-gie won-der-land.

Dance, boo-gie won-der-land.

All the love in the world can't be gone.
All the need to be loved can't be wrong.

All the rec-ords are play-ing,
And my heart keep say-ing,
Boo--oo-gie won-der-land, won-der-land.

Dance, boo-gie won-der-land.

Kung Fu Fighting
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah

Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up
They were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art
And everybody knew their part
From a fainting, to a slip
And a kickin' from the hip
Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit fright'ning
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billie Chin and little Sammy Chong
He said, here comes the big boss, let's get it on
We took the bow and made a stand
Started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip
Now we're into a brand new trip

Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit fright'ning
But they did it with expert timing

Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, ha
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh, ha
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh-ha
Keep on, keep on, keep on
Sure enough
Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those kids were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit fright'ning
Make sure you have expert timing
Kung Fu fighting, had to be fast as lightning...
